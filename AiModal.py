print("""Shadows fall, your memory burns,
Every page, my heart still turns.
I scream your name into the cold,
But no one listens, no one holds.

Pre-Chorus
Anger rises where love once lived,
Bitter lessons that life won’t forgive.
I’m tangled in the web of what we were,
Every word from you, still a blur.

Chorus
I love the nights, though they tear me apart,
Sadness and fury still live in my heart.
Through the silence, through the cries,
I love the nights, where love never dies.

Verse 2
Your laughter haunts the empty hall,
I chase your shadow, I hit the wall.
I burn bridges I once called home,
And drown in memories I can’t disown.

Pre-Chorus 2
I hate the truth, I hate the lies,
But I can’t escape your hollow eyes.
Love’s a curse I can’t erase,
A twisted beauty I can’t replace.

Chorus
I love the nights, though they tear me apart,
Sadness and fury still live in my heart.
Through the silence, through the cries,
I love the nights, where love never dies.

Bridge / Twist
Was it love or just a game?
I burn in anger, whisper your name.
Every ending is a start,
Every shadow a piece of my heart.
I’m lost in fury, lost in desire,
But even in fire, I feel you inspire.

Final Chorus
I love the nights, where the darkness sings,
Of broken promises and shattered wings.
Through the rage, through the pain,
I love the nights, I love the rain.
Even if love is cruel and unkind,
I love the nights where you’re still mine""")
